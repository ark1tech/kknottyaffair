          Kim and King first crossed paths as high school classmates at Nueva
          Ecija University of Science and Technology in 2008. Their journey from
          acquaintances to best friends began in 2010 when they were seated next
          to each other in a third-year Chemistry class. This seating
          arrangement sparked a friendship that grew stronger over time,
          eventually blossoming into a deep and lasting bond.

          As college approached, their paths diverged as they pursued their
          individual goals and aspirations, leading to a temporary sacrifice of
          their friendship. However, fate had other plans. The two reunited when
          King informed Kim that they had moved to the same subdivision where
          Kim resided in Cabanatuan City. They rekindled their bond over simple
          conversations, enjoying McFlurries over their backyard dates or
          sipping coffee during their “bring your friend to work” trips.

          As cliché as it may sound, their story unfolded as if the stars had
          aligned, bringing them back together. Kim and King became a couple on
          January 6, 2022, in Baguio City, and got officially engaged on June
          16, 2024, in Tagaytay City.
