        When our eyes meet, the world slows down. With every smile, every
        glance, and every touch, we find ourselves falling&mdash;over and over
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is our love story, one that will last a lifetime. From this day
        forward, we promise to hold on, to dance through every season, and to
        stand by each other&mdash;until our hands are wrinkled and our hearts
        are still beating as one.
      </p>
      <p>Join us as we begin forever.</p>
